INTRODUCTION

World in Conflict supports in-game server administration via the game console, various tasks can be done this way such as map change, kick/ban functionality and much more. This is a quick and easy method to moderate a World in Conflict game and solve issues when the administrator is already connected to the server.

To be able to perform administration when there is no wish to play or spectate a World in Conflict game the need of starting the game client and connect to the server can be messy. 

For this reason the World in Conflict dedicated server can be remotely administrated by connecting to a TCP socket and sending text based commands. This document explains how to set up remote administration and includes a reference for the server commands.

SET UP REMOTE ADMINISTRATION

The wic_ds.ini file in the World in Conflict directory contains two tags of interest for remote administration. The [AdminPassword] tag specifies the password a client needs to provide to authenticate itself with the dedicated server. [AdminPort] specifies a TCP port that the dedicated server uses to listen for incoming connections. A password must be set for the server to listen for connections.

For more information of tags in the wic_ds.ini file, see the World in Conflict Dedicated Server Manual.

CONNECTING TO A DEDICATED SERVER

Any client that can connect to an arbitrary TCP port and send text commands, such as telnet, is supported. However a client with unicode support is recommended. When connection is established the first thing the client must send is the same password as specified in wic_ds.ini encoded in ASCII. After the password is verified the client can send text commands.
