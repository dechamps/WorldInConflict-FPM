¤ ¤ ¤ INSTALLATION
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _


Before you install the game, make sure that your computer has the latest 
hardware drivers installed. Old drivers can stop the game from working 
properly. Insert the World in Conflict: Soviet Assault DVD into your DVD-ROM 
drive. The installation program runs automatically. Follow the on-screen 
instructions. 

If the installation program doesn't appear automatically, double-click the 
My Computer icon on the Desktop, and then double-click on the DVD-ROM drive 
that contains the game DVD. Double-click on the "setup.exe" file to launch 
the installation program.

If you purchased this game via download, simply double-click on the file you 
just downloaded and follow the on-screen instructions.  Note: You will not 
need to have a disc in the DVD-ROM drive to play.

--------
Starting the Game
--------

You start the game by double-clicking the "World in Conflict" desktop
shortcut or "wic.exe" in your installation directory. In Windows Vista™, you
can find the shortcut in the Games Explorer. This gives you access
to the full game: the single-player campaign, tutorial, local network play,
online play, etc. The full game requires you to have your game disk in the
DVD-ROM drive.

--- Playing Online Only

If you exclusively want to play online through Massgate™, you can
double-click the "World in Conflict - Online Only" desktop shortcut or
"wic_online.exe" in your installation directory. This executable does not
require you to have the World in Conflict disk in your DVD-ROM drive. In 
Windows Vista™, you can right click on the icon and select Play Online Only.
Please note that all single-player and local network game menus (Single Player, 
Tutorial, Local Network) are disabled when starting the Online Only version.

¤ ¤ ¤ HOW TO PLAY
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _


World in Conflict is a unique tactical-strategy game with an emphasis on 
teamwork. As a player, you can choose either to play the story-driven 
single-player campaign or to join or host a multiplayer game to compete 
against other players or AI. These two options are available in the Main menu, 
which first appears when you start World in Conflict. Although the two game 
modes are different, they share many of the same basic mechanics. 


--------
Basic Controls
--------


World in Conflict is a tactical strategy game, where you control a number of 
units on a large-scale map using the mouse and keyboard. With the default 
settings, you can pan the camera around with the W, A, S and D keys on your 
keyboard: W for forward movement, S for backward movement and A and D for 
strafing left or right. You can rotate the camera by holding the middle mouse 
button down or by dragging the cursor to any of the four sides of the screen.

The mouse is also your central tool in controlling your units. You can move 
the cursor around and select units by left-clicking on them, or by holding 
down the left mouse button and dragging a selection square around them. 
Once the units are selected, you can issue movement or attack orders by 
right-clicking on the battlefield or enemy units.


--------
Buying units
--------


Battles in World in Conflict take place in various locations, far away from 
military bases and construction sites. Therefore, commanders have to call in 
reinforcements. In the single-player mode, the selection of units is decided 
by the mission and its circumstances, while in the multiplayer mode, it is 
decided by the role you choose. All the units are selected from the 
Reinforcement Menu.

The upper section of the Reinforcement Menu displays the units that are 
available for purchase. All units cost points, and you have a set number of 
points to utilize. These points aren't exhausted, but rather invested; if 
you purchase a unit that costs 1200 points, you will regain the points over 
time once that unit has died or been destroyed.

The lower section of the menu displays your selected units, the ones you 
plan to deploy on the battlefield. Once you've selected an amount of units 
that you are happy with, you can deploy them by sending them to your drop 
zone. The drop zone can be placed within a specific area of the map, which 
can also change during the course of a match. You can select your own 
individual drop zone within this area at any time.


--------
The Game Modes
--------


The game features three, diverse, multiplayer modes that all emphasize 
teamwork and individual skills. The game modes are map-specific and feature 
different takes on the concept of map control. The three game modes are 
Domination, Assault and Tug of War.

--- Domination

In Domination mode, two teams fight for domination over a number of Command 
Points that are spread out across the map. The team that controls the most 
Command Points will push the Domination bar to that team's advantage. You 
win Domination by holding the majority of the Domination bar, either when 
the time runs out or by holding it completely. If you control all the 
Command Points on the map, the Domination bar will move twice as fast as it 
did before. This is called Total Domination.

--- Assault

Assault mode is played in a set of two rounds. One team acts as defender 
while the other team plays the role of attacker. The attacking team must 
take a number of Command Points in a pre-set order of succession. When the 
attacking team takes control of the first Command Point, a second Command 
Point will appear behind it. When time runs out, or when the attackers take 
control of all the Command Points, the sides are reversed and it's the other 
team's turn to attack. In order to win, the second team must capture more 
Command Points than the first attacking team or capture them faster than the 
first attacking team.

--- Tug of War

In Tug of War mode, one long Command Point acts as a frontline. Both teams 
struggle to control all the Perimeter Points at the same time to push the 
frontline forward. The map is won when one team pushes the frontline all the 
way to the other team's side, or when a team has pushed the enemy back and 
holds the majority of the map when the time runs out.

--- Few-Player Mode

All the different game modes can also be played in Few-Player Mode. 
Few-Player Mode is a special mode where the game is tuned for 1 on 1 or 
2 on 2. In Few-Player Mode, the role system is removed and the Reinforcement 
Points are vastly increased, to make sure that all the players get enough 
firepower to fight off their enemy. This game mode puts a lot of demand on 
player's individual skills, and is great for commanders who like to have 
full control of the battle.


--------
Command Points
--------

As you play World in Conflict, you will at times encounter Command Points. 
Command Points are key points on maps that can be controlled. The basic 
Command Point consists of two or three circles, or Perimeter Points, that 
are captured when you place a unit within the circle. To fully capture a 
Command Point, you have to place units within all the connected circles.


--------
Fortifications
--------


It is wise to remember that the enemy is just as interested in Command Points 
as you are, and that the points must be protected after they've been captured. 
This can be done by constructing Fortifications. Fortifications are defensive 
structures that can be built around all individual circles at Command Points. 

There are three different types of Fortifications: machine gun, anti-tank and 
anti-air. The Fortifications are built over time as units occupy one of the 
captured circles. But although they can give the enemy a hard time, 
Fortifications can be destroyed, so don't rely upon them too much.


--------
Reinforcement Points
--------


To order units you have to spend Reinforcement Points. All units cost 
Reinforcement Points. At the start of the match you have 4000 points available 
and another 2000 incoming. When you buy units, your available points decrease. 
When units are killed, you get the points back in the incoming pool, so that 
you can order new units again. The maximum limit for Reinforcement Points is 
6000 points.


--------
Special Abilities
--------


Most units have Special Abilities, and they are designed to help your units 
survive battle with the enemy. The Special Abilities vary from powerful 
attack abilities to evasive or defensive abilities that can help you survive 
or escape an otherwise lost battle. Don't forget to use your Special 
Abilities!


--------
Tactical Aid Points
--------


As you play and capture Command Points, you are awarded Tactical Aid points. 
These can be spent on various powerful weapons, such as air strikes, 
artillery barrages or tactical nukes. To use your Tactical Aids, press the 
"Tactical Aids" button in the upper left corner.

The Tactical Aids are divided into three groups, one supportive and two 
damage-dealing groups. All of the weapons can be ordered in three different 
strengths, each higher level increasing the Tactical Aid Point cost for the 
delivery. Whenever you deploy a tactical aid weapon, there is a delivery 
delay, so make sure that you synch it with your enemy's location. Take care 
not to hurt your teammates as well – Tactical Aid weapons do heavy damage, 
regardless of affiliation.

¤ ¤ ¤ THE ROLES
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _


All the units available in the game are divided between four different roles. 
As a player of a team game, you can only choose one role to play at a time, 
and you will have to rely on your teammate's to cover your back when you need 
it. Even though some of the units are available across the role borders, 
there's no doubt that commanders who choose a certain role have certain 
expectations on themselves from their teammates.


-------- 
Armor
--------


The armor role is for anyone who likes to keep it simple. With unparalleled 
defense, the armor role is a powerful presence on ground. Tanks hold their 
ground very well, and the transport vehicles work as helpful aid in 
fast-paced advancements and give tanks some moderate protection against 
enemy helicopters.


--------
Air
--------


The air role is perfect for commanders who prefer fast movement and high 
attack power. The transport and scout helicopters also give the team the 
benefit of larger visual range and mobility on the battlefield. But although 
the air role is a powerful offensive force, it lacks the ability to capture 
Command Points.


--------
Infantry
--------


The infantry role puts a lot of demands on the commander. Being the most 
vulnerable to enemy fire, infantry units have to depend on movement and 
stealth to survive against enemy vehicles. Able to hide in forests and 
buildings, infantry units are most at home in the wilderness and larger 
cities. Armed with highly effective firearms, they pose a big threat against 
all other roles if played well.


--------
Support
--------


The support role is probably one of the most diverse roles available, with 
many different uses. Besides its very effective mobile artillery and anti-air 
vehicles, the support role also includes repair tanks that can aid friendly 
tanks. The support role can be hard to master, but it is an essential role 
for a strong and intimidating army.

too far away.


--------

If a disc is returned without proof of purchase or after the warranty period

expense.  This warranty is invalid if the disc has been damaged through 
negligence, accident or misuse, or if it has been modified after acquisition.

8-	Warrantee Limitation

The User recognises expressly that he uses the Multimedia Product at his own 
risk.
The Multimedia Product is provided as is, without any warranty other than what 
is laid down in Article 5 of the Licence. The User is responsible for any 
costs of repairing and/or correcting the Multimedia Product.
To the extent of what is laid down by law, Ubisoft rejects any warranty 
relating to the market value of the Multimedia Product, the User’s 
satisfaction or its capacity to perform a specific use.
The User is responsible for all risks connected with lost profit, lost data, 
errors and lost business or other information as a result of owning or using 
the Multimedia Product.
As some legislations do not allow for the aforementioned warranty limitation, 
it is possible that it does not apply to the User.

9-	Liability

In no event can Ubisoft be held liable for any direct, consequential, 
accidental, special, ancillary or other damages arising out of the use or 
inability to use the Multimedia Product, as well as out of the ownership or 
poor functioning thereof, even if Ubisoft has been advised of the possibility 
of such damages.
In particular, Ubisoft accepts no liability regarding use of the Multimedia 
Product contrary to the precautions for use set out in the manual and on the 
packaging.
As some legislations do not allow exemption from liability in the event of 
direct or incidental damages, it is possible that the aforementioned exclusion 
does not apply to the User.
This Licence to use the Multimedia Product grants specific rights to the User 
and he may have other rights depending on the laws in his State.
